**Changes:**  
* Fixed untextured parrots in guis (path for parrots was moved) [Thanks fron#0019 and Noelle#7956]  
* Fixed untextured crossbows, bows, and guns (model overrides were not set properly)  
* Fixed various items (including tesseracts) that specified texture in .properties file while actually using multiple textures in linked model (removed texture assignment from .properties)
* Replaced #missing unset texture in some item models with an empty texture (outputs errors otherwise)
* Fixed custom models by adding missing parts and missing uv elements (wouldn't load/outputs errors with stuff missing)  
* Fixed all broken paths (removed all non-vanilla allowed characters from paths)
  
**Thanks to the Monumenta RP creators for making the pack and having to deal with OptiFine jank.**
