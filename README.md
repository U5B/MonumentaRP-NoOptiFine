### Information
Built on Monumenta RP v4.1.0  
  
**Contributors:**  
usb#3568  
Vladomeme#2984 (Literally the maintainer of this resourcepack now)  
Noelle#7956 (Resource Pack Lead, helped with finding solutions to bugs)  
fron#0019 (Reporting a bunch of bugs)  
JuceDoesThings#2020 (Messing with villager models to not be headless)  

**Changes:**  
Fixed untextured parrots in guis (path for parrots was moved) [Thanks fron#0019 and Noelle#7956]  
Fixed untextured crossbows, bows, and guns (model overrides were not set properly)  
Fixed various items (including tesseracts) that specified texture in .properties file while actually using multiple textures in linked model (removed texture assignment from .properties)  
Fixed Villager model by adding missing uv elements (ignored by optifine for some reason)
Added texture files for entities with different states (angry wolfs, bees etc.)  
Fixed all broken paths (paths using non-vanilla allowed characters)

**Broken Things:**   
Charged creeper auras use default texture (Not supported by ETF yet)
  
**Thanks to the Monumenta RP creators for making the pack and having to deal with OptiFine jank.**
