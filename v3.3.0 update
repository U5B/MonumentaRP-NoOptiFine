Everything item related is done
Not done: spiders, villagers, and a wither since I'm not familiar with entities

Spiders and a wither is done:
villagers I will look into later

Seemingly fixed all issues with villagers, everything for the update should be done
Remove that file I guess and it's ready to merge
